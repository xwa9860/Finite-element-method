\section{Introduction}

The objective of this project is to solve a 1-D differential equation using linear elements.  

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dx}(A_1(x) \frac{du}{dx}) &=& f(x)\nonumber\\
f(x)&=&256sin(\frac{3\pi kx}{4})cos(16 \pi x) \nonumber\\
A_1(x)& = & piecewise\nonumber\\
L&=&1 \nonumber\\
u(0)& =& 0 \nonumber\\
A1(L)\frac{du}{dx}(L) &=& 1 \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}

$A_1$ is a piece wise function, defined as bellow:

\begin{eqnarray}
For & 0.0 \leq x < 0.1 :& A_1 = 2.0 \nonumber\\
For & 0.1 \leq x < 0.2 :& A_1 = 2.5 \nonumber\\
For & 0.2 \leq x < 0.3 :& A_1 = 1.25 \nonumber\\
For & 0.3 \leq x < 0.4 :& A_1 = 0.25 \nonumber\\
For & 0.4 \leq x < 0.5 :& A_1 = 4.0 \nonumber\\
For & 0.5 \leq x < 0.6 :& A_1 = 1.75 \nonumber\\
For & 0.6 \leq x < 0.7 :& A_1 = 0.5 \nonumber\\
For & 0.7 \leq x < 0.8 :& A_1 = 0.75 \nonumber\\
For & 0.8 \leq x < 0.9 :& A_1 = 3.25\nonumber\\
For & 0.9 \leq x \leq 1.0 :& A_1 = 1.0
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Analytical solution}

The general solution for this equation on every segment can be found after two integrations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{du_ana}
A_1(x)\frac{du}{dx}&=& \int 256sin(\frac{3\pi kx}{4})cos(16 \pi x) dx\nonumber\\
&=& \int 128[sin(\frac{67 \pi x}{4}) - sin(\frac{61 \pi x}{4})]\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{512(67cos(\frac{61\pi x}{4})- 61cos(\frac{67\pi x}{4}))}{4087\pi} + C1
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{du}{dx} &=& \frac{1}{A_1(x)} (\frac{ 512( 67cos( \frac{61\pi x}{4} )- 61cos( \frac{67\pi x}{4} ) ) }  {4087\pi} + C1)
\end{eqnarray}

Integrating $\frac{du}{dx}$, we obtain the analytical solution for the differencial equation:

\begin{eqnarray}
u(x)&=& \frac{1}{A1(x)}\frac{\frac{137216sin(\frac{61\pi x}{4})}{61\pi}- \frac{124928sin(\frac{67\pi x}{4}))}{67\pi}}{4087\pi} + \frac{C1x} {A_1(x)} + C2
\end{eqnarray}

where C1 and C2 are piecewise constants that can be calculated using the boundary conditions and interface conditions.

At the interface between segments $x_N$ (N=1,...,10), the function u and its derivation is continuous, i.e.,

\begin{eqnarray}
u(x_N^+) = u(x_N^-) \nonumber\\
A1(x_N^+)\frac{du} {dx}(x_N^+) = A1(x_N^-)\frac{du}{dx}(x_N^-)
\end{eqnarray}


In particular, at the left endpoint, $u(0) = u_0 = 0$ and at the right end point, $A1(L)\frac{du}{dx} (L) = 1$ .

Applying the boundary conditions and continuation conditions at the interfaces, we can solve the equation system and obtain the analytical solution:

\begin{eqnarray}
For & 0.0 \leq x < 0.1 :& C_1 = 1.1692 \nonumber\\
For & 0.1 \leq x < 0.2 :& C_1 = 1.1692 \nonumber\\
For & 0.2 \leq x < 0.3 :& C_1 = 1.1692 \nonumber\\
For & 0.3 \leq x < 0.4 :& C_1 = 1.1692 \nonumber\\
For & 0.4 \leq x < 0.5 :& C_1 = 1.1692 \nonumber\\
For & 0.5 \leq x < 0.6 :& C_1 = 1.1692 \nonumber\\
For & 0.6 \leq x < 0.7 :& C_1 = 1.1692 \nonumber\\
For & 0.7 \leq x < 0.8 :& C_1 = 1.1692 \nonumber\\
For & 0.8 \leq x < 0.9 :& C_1 = 1.1692\nonumber\\
For & 0.9 \leq x \leq 1.0 :& C_1 = 1.1692
\end{eqnarray}


\begin{eqnarray}
For & 0.0 \leq x < 0.1 :& C_2 = 0 \nonumber\\
For & 0.1 \leq x < 0.2 :& C_2 = 0.0101\nonumber\\
For & 0.2 \leq x < 0.3 :& C_2 = -0.0964 \nonumber\\
For & 0.3 \leq x < 0.4 :& C_2 = =1.4040 \nonumber\\
For & 0.4 \leq x < 0.5 :& C_2 = 0.2742 \nonumber\\
For & 0.5 \leq x < 0.6 :& C_2 = 0.1166 \nonumber\\
For & 0.6 \leq x < 0.7 :& C_2 = -0.8391 \nonumber\\
For & 0.7 \leq x < 0.8 :& C_2 = -0.2384 \nonumber\\
For & 0.8 \leq x < 0.9 :& C_2 = 0.7997\nonumber\\
For & 0.9 \leq x \leq 1.0 :& C_2 = 0.0931
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Finite Element Method}

\subsection{Weak form
}
The first step of FEM is to derive the weak form of the differential equation:



\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{Find u, u|$\Gamma$ u =d, such that $\forall$ v, v|$\Gamma$ u =0} \nonumber\\
\int_{\Omega} \frac{dv}{dx} A_1(x) \frac{du}{dx} dx = \int_{\Omega} fv dx + tv \mid _{\Gamma t}
\end{eqnarray}


We approximate the real solution u by

\begin{eqnarray}
u(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} a_j \phi_j(x)
\end{eqnarray}

and we choose the test function v with the same approximation functions

\begin{eqnarray}
v(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} b_i \phi_i(x)
\end{eqnarray}

where N is the number of degree of freedom(number of nodes). 


Then the equation becomes:

\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{\Omega} \frac{d}{dx} (\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} a_j \phi_j(x)) A_1(x) \frac{d}{dx} (\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} b_i \phi_i(x))dx = \int_{\Omega} f (\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} b_i \phi_i(x)) dx + (\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} b_i \phi_i(x) t) \mid _{\Gamma t}, \forall b_i
\end{eqnarray}


We can regroup the terms into:

\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} b_i \int_{\Omega} (\sum_{j=1}^{N+1} a_j \frac{d}{dx} \phi_j(x) A_1(x) \frac{d}{dx} \phi_i(x)) dx = \sum_{i=1}^{N+1} b_i \int_{\Omega} f \phi_i(x) dx + \sum_{i=1}^{N+1} b_i (\phi_i(x) t) \mid _{\Gamma t}
\end{eqnarray}

As the equation should be valid for any $b_i$, we obtain the matrix system to solve:
 
\begin{eqnarray}
K_{ij} &=& \int_{\Omega} \frac{d}{dx} \phi_j(x) A_1(x) \frac{d}{dx} \phi_i(x) dx \nonumber\\
R_i &=& \int_{\Omega} f \phi_i(x) dx + \phi_i(x) t \mid _{\Gamma t}\nonumber\\
K a &=& R
\end{eqnarray}

Linear shape functions are defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\phi_1} &=& \frac{1-\xi}{2}\nonumber\\
\hat{\phi_2} &=& \frac{1+\xi}{2}
\end{eqnarray}

and

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\hat{\phi_1}}{d\xi} &=& -\frac{1}{2}\nonumber\\
\frac{d\hat{\phi_2}}{d\xi} &=& \frac{1}{2}
\end{eqnarray}

Corresponding global coordinate x can be calculate x from $\xi$:

\begin{equation}
x = \sum{\chi _i \hat{\phi _i}}
\end{equation} 
where $\chi_i$ are the coordinates of the nodes in the global element. 

\subsection{Data structure}

Matrix K is assembled from symmetric 2x2 element matrices. KE table is used to store only the three elements in Ke: Ke(1, 1), Ke(1, 2) and Ke(2, 2). The connectivity table stores the endpoints of each mesh element, in the case of 1D meshing, the connectivity table is: 

\begin{eqnarray}
connectivity = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1, 2\\
    2, 3\\
    3, 4\\
    \vdots
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
KE_{table} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
K_{11}^1& K_{12}^1& K_{22}^1 \\
K_{11}^2& K_{12}^2& K_{22}^2 \\
 &...&\\
K_{11}^{Ne}& K_{12}^{Ne}& K_{22}^{Ne}         
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
K_{11} & K_{12} & K_{13}\\
K_{21} & K_{22} & K_{23} \\
 &...&\\
K_{N1}& K_{N2} & K_{N3}         
\end{pmatrix}
\end{eqnarray}

The multiplication operation of KE table and an array Q (y=KE table * Q)is 

\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{Loop through e:} &&\nonumber\\
Ke &= & KE table[e] \nonumber\\
Qe &= & Q(connectivity[e]) \nonumber\\
y_e &= & Ke * Qe \nonumber\\
y(connectivity[e]) & += & y_e \nonumber\\  
\end{eqnarray}


And the operation of $T^T*K*T$ is:

\begin{eqnarray}
T^T*K*T = 
\begin{pmatrix}
K_{11}T_1T_1 & K_{12}T_1T_2 & K_{13} T_1T_3 \\
K_{21}T_2T_1 & K_{22}T_2T_2 & K_{23} T_2T_3 \\
 & \cdots &\\
K_{N1}T_NT_1 & K_{N2}T_NT_2 & K_{N3} T_NT_3 \\ 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{eqnarray}
 

\subsection{Applying boundary condition to KE table and R}

As discussed in the previous homeworks, for Dirichlet BC on u(0):
\begin{align*}
K(1,1)& =& 1, K(1, 2) =0 \\
R(1) &=& u(0)\\
\mbox{in the form of KE table:} &&\\
R(1) &=& u(0)\\
R(2) &=& R(2)-KE_{table} (1,2) * u(0)\\
KE_{table} (1, 1) & =& 1, KE_{table} (1, 2) =0
\end{align*}

For Dirichlet BC on u(L):
\begin{align*}
K(N,N) &=&1,K(N, 1:N-1) =0\\ 
R(N) &=& u(L) \\
\mbox{in the form of KE table:} &&\\
R(N)&=&u(L)\\
R(N-1)&=&R(N-1)-KE_{table} (N-1,2) * u(L)\\
KE_{table} (N-1, 3)& =&1, KE_{table} (N-1, 2) =0
\end{align*}


Neumann boundary condition gives the value of traction $A1(x)\frac{du}{dx}$ on an end point. The implementation doesn't change if KE table is used.

For Neumann BC on x=0:

 $R(1) = R(1) + A_1 \frac{du}{dx}[x=0] $


For Neumann BC on x=L:

 $R(N)=R(N)+ A_1 \frac{du}{dx}[x=L] $

\section{Preconditioned conjugate-gradient solver}

There are two approaches to solve the equation for [K]{a} = {R}, direct and iterative. The number of operations in direct solvers are  $O(N^3)$. They are employed when the number of unknowns are not very large, and there are multiple load vectors. Iterative solver are prefered when the systems are very large. Conjugate gradient type iterative techniques need only $O(N^2)$ operations. 

We define a potential(eq\ref{eq: Pi}) whose derivative is the residual of the equation to solve. So the minimizer of the potential $\Pi$ is the solution to the equation. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\bigtriangledown \Pi = [K]\{a\} - \{R\}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq: Pi}
\Pi = \frac{1}{2} \{a\}^T [K] \{a\} - \{a\}^T\{R\}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq: residual}
\{r\}^i = - \bigtriangledown \Pi = \{R\} - [K] \{a\}^i \nonumber\\
\{a\}^{i+1} = \{a\}^i + \lambda^i \{r\}^i
\end{eqnarray}

The idea of steepest descent is to find this minimizer of potential by going to the direction of the gradiant of the potential, i.e. $\{a\} ^{i+1} = \{a\} ^i + \lambda ^i \{z\} ^i $, where $\{z\}^i = \{r\}^i + \theta ^i\{z\}^{i-1}$. The coefficient $\theta$ is chosen so that {z} is [K] conjugate to $\{z\}^{i-1}$, i.e.,

\begin{eqnarray}
\{z\}^{T, i} [K] \{z\} ^{i-1} =0 \nonumber\\
\theta^i = - \frac{\{r\}^{T,i} [K] \{z\} ^ {i-1}} {\{z\} ^{T,i-1} [K] \{z\}^{i-1} }
\end{eqnarray}

Looking for $\lambda$ to minimize the potential, we force $\frac{\partial {\Pi}}{\partial \lambda ^i} =0 $ and solve for $\lambda$:

\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda ^i = \frac{ \{z\}^{T,i} \{r\}^i} { \{z\}^{T,i}[K]\{z\}^i}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Preconditioning of [K]}
The rate of convergence of the CG method is related to the condition number

\begin{eqnarray}
\| \{a\} - \{ a\}^i \| _K \leq (\frac{ \sqrt{C([K]) -1} }{ \sqrt{C([K]) + 1} }) ^i \| \{a\} - \{a\} ^1 \| _K
\end{eqnarray}

To reduce the condition number, preconditioning of [K] is done by forming the transformation of variables:
\begin{eqnarray}
T^{T}KT  [T^{-1} A] = [T^T R] \nonumber\\
\bar{[K]} = [T] ^T [K] [T] \nonumber\\
\bar{R} = T^T R \nonumber\\
\bar{[K]}a = \bar{R} \nonumber\\
A = aT 
\end{eqnarray} 

Diagonal preconditioning is an inexpensive widely used, where [T] is defined from the diaganol of [K] as:
\begin{eqnarray}
T_{ij} = \frac{1} { \sqrt{ K_{ij} } }, i,j = 1, ... ndof 
\end{eqnarray}
Note that in order to use this preconditioner, the diagonal of K has to be positive, as in our case.

\subsection{iteration}
Starting from an initial guess for $\{a\}^0$, we can calculate the residual defined as in equation \ref{eq: residual}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq: residual}
\{r\}^0 &=& - \bigtriangledown \Pi = \{R\} - [K] \{a\}^0 \nonumber\\
\{z\}^0 &=& \{r\}^0 \nonumber\\
\lambda ^0 &=& \frac{ \{z\}^{T,0} \{r\}^0} { \{z\}^{T,0}[K]\{z\}^0} \nonumber\\
\{a\}^{1} &=& \{a\}^0 + \lambda^0 \{z\}^0
\end{eqnarray}

For iteration i >0, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\{r\}^i &=& \{R\} - [K] \{a\}^i \nonumber\\
\theta^i &=& - \frac{\{r\}^{T,i} [K] \{z\} ^ {i-1}} {\{z\} ^{T,i-1} [K] \{z\}^{i-1} }\nonumber\\
\{z\} &=& \{r\} ^i + \theta ^i \{z\} ^{i-1} \nonumber\\
\lambda ^i &=& \frac{ \{z\}^{T,i} \{r\}^i} { \{z\}^{T,i}[K]\{z\}^i} \nonumber\\
\{a\} ^{i+1} &=& \{a\} ^i + \lambda ^i \{z\} ^i  \nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}

and compute the error for each iteration as:

\begin{eqnarray}
e^i = \frac{\|\{a\}^i - \{a\}^i \| _K } { \| \{ a\}^i \| _k} = \frac{ \mid \lambda ^i \mid \| \{z\} \| _K }{ \| \{ a\} ^i _K \|} 
\end{eqnarray}

If $e^i < \tau$ stop, otherwise reiterate. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Error Calculations}
The error is defined as 

\begin{eqnarray}
e^N = \frac{\| u -u^N \| _{A_1(\Omega)}} {\| u \| _{A_1 (\Omega)}} \nonumber\\
\| u \| _{A_1 (\Omega)} = \sqrt{\int_{\Omega} \frac{du}{dx} A_1 \frac{du}{dx} dx} = \sqrt{\int_{\Omega} A_1(\frac{du}{dx})^2 dx}\nonumber\\
\| u -u^N \| _{A_1(\Omega)} = \sqrt{\int_{\Omega} A_1 (\frac{d(u-u^N)}{dx})^2 dx}
\end{eqnarray}

To compute the error numerically, we calculate the two following quantities element by element, and then assemble them to obtain the overall error:

\begin{eqnarray}
\| u \| _{A_1(x) (\Omega)}^2 &=&\int_{\Omega} A_1(x)(\frac{du}{dx})^2 dx\nonumber\\
\| u -u^N \| _{A_1(x)(\Omega)} ^2 &=& \int_{\Omega} A_1(x) (\frac{d(u-u^N)}{dx})^2 dx\nonumber\\
&=& A_1(x) \int_{\Omega} (\frac{du}{dx} - \frac{du_N}{dx})^2 dx\nonumber\\
&=& A_1(x) \sum_{e=1}^{N_e} \int_{x_e}^{x_{e+1}} (\frac{du}{dx} - \frac{du_N}{dx})^2 dx \nonumber\\
&=& A_1(x) \sum_{e=1}^{N_e} \int_{-1}^{1} (\frac{du}{d\xi} - \frac{du_N}{d\xi})^2 J d\xi
\end{eqnarray}
